  title: Breadth First Search
  description: 'Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching graph and
    tree structures. It works by exploring all the adjacent nodes around the start
    point, then exploring the adjacent nodes around each of those nodes, and repeats
    this process until the goal is found or every node has been explored.

    To
    achieve this, BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the order in which
    each node is discovered; it then explores them in the order in which they are
    queued.


    The modified version of this algorithm used in this demonstration
    also stores the previous node for each node. This means that when the goal is
    discovered, it can reliably backtrack through each node it explored in order
    to reach that goal, and thus it can return the shortest path from the start to
    the end points.'
